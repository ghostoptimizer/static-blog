This blog was probably the coolest projects I've done yet, I only spent 3 months building it, broke it 12 times, spent hours trying to find the most simplest bugs but I've learned more from completing this entire project than most other methods I've tried. Hopefully its insightful and helps in some way! 

Que pasa, I'm Jadon and I love working with technology as a whole, in my free time I really just enjoy the small things in life but traveling is just where it's AT my friends, gotta get a little culture in me ya know? 

Currently Working On:

 - Kubernetes Homelab (bare metal Ibuypower PC)
 - Languages: Golang and Python
 - Cloud Concepts (AWS)

Thanks for stopping by!
