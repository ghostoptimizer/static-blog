Hi I'm Jadon and I love working with technology as a whole, I joined tech out of curiosity and respect for how deeply it impacts people’s lives. In my free time I really just enjoy the small things in life but traveling is just where it's AT my friends but ultimately I’m here to learn, build, and hopefully help tech serve humans a little better.

This blog was probably the coolest projects I've done yet, I only spent 3 months building it, broke it 12 times, spent hours hunting the most simplest bugs but I've learned more from completing this entire project than almost any other method I've tried. Hopefully its insightful and helps in some way! 

I don't have a background in tech and decided to start early May, 2025 where I was then opened up to the world of DevOps/SRE and loved it. Here are some things I'm currently working on:

 - Bare-metal Kubernetes homelab (iBuyPower PC)
 - Languages: Golang and Python
 - Cloud Concepts (AWS)

Let me know what you think about the blog, send me a DM - let's talk some shit or I can buy you a coffee, maybe help each other out
